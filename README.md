# Intelligent Complaint Analysis for Financial Services

## Overview
CrediTrust Financial receives thousands of customer complaints monthly across products like Credit Cards, Personal Loans, BNPL, Savings Accounts, and Money Transfers. This project delivers an internal AI-powered tool that transforms unstructured complaint data into actionable insights using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

**Key Features:**
- Natural language chatbot for internal teams (Product, Support, Compliance, Executives)
- Semantic search using vector database (FAISS/ChromaDB) to retrieve relevant complaint narratives
- LLM-powered answer generation with evidence from real complaints
- Multi-product querying and comparison

## Business Objectives
- **Reduce time to identify complaint trends** from days to minutes
- **Empower non-technical teams** to get answers without a data analyst
- **Enable proactive problem-solving** based on real-time feedback

## Data
- Based on Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaint data
- Each record includes: issue label, free-text narrative, product/company info, submission date, and metadata
